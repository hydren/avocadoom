Take inspirations from ZDL.

TODO list

Improvements:
- Change settings.ini to a .properties file and parse with java's Properties class. Do the same with presets files. Handle multi-entries (Paths) separately.

Features:
- Buttons to change order from mods.
- Create presets from selecting mods at main window (using right-click and/or a button)
- Offer more Look&Feel's
- Launch more than one preset together
- Create presets from other presets' mods
- Create presets made up other presets (really painfull to do)

Bugs:

- <DevilHunter>'s bug about Pwads not loading in order. (Not confirmed)

Requests:

- From <one_Two>, "... offer different views for the wad/mod selection - like icons so they're easier to find."
- Also from <one_Two>, "(...) And maybe make the preset thing a bit more on the fly so it's quicker to start a game with a few mods, not sure if it's included but cl parameters would be good"
